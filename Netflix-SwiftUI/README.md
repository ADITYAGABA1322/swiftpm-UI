#  Netflix Swift-UI

Netflix Onboarding made with SwiftUI.

## Overview

Welcome to the Netflix 

Netflix is a popular streaming service that provides movies, TV shows, and documentaries to subscribers. In iOS app development,
 Netflix's user interface can be recreated using SwiftUI, Apple's declarative framework for building user interfaces.

The Netflix SwiftUI app typically includes a home screen that displays recommended content, a search screen for finding specific titles,
and a detail screen for viewing information about a selected title. The app may also have a profile screen where users can manage their
account information and settings.

To create the Netflix UI, developers can use a combination of SwiftUI views and modifiers to create a visually appealing and functional
app. Views like VStack, HStack, and ZStack can be used to arrange and layer content, while modifiers like frame, padding, and
foregroundColor can adjust the layout and appearance of individual elements.

Overall, the Netflix SwiftUI app showcases the power and flexibility of SwiftUI for creating complex and polished user interfaces.
