## By developers and for developers

I am an iOS developer and currently using Swift.

**This repo does not merely follow tutorials, I re-build them with better code style and architecture design.**

For code style, I strictly follow [raywenderlich.com Swift Style Guide](https://github.com/raywenderlich/swift-style-guide);

For developers, I have a README file and screenshots for every single app in this repo, all details could be found there.

## What's next?

I will maintain the project with latest syntax and most advanced code style. More code comments are going to be covered as well.

Also, **unit tests** will be added to ensure the quality of the codebase.
