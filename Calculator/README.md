# Calculator

Calculator made with SwiftUI.

## Overview

A calculator made with SwiftUI is a user interface that allows users to perform mathematical calculations. It typically consists of a display area where the numbers and results are shown, along with buttons representing various mathematical operations and numeric digits.

The calculator UI is designed using SwiftUI, which is a modern framework for building user interfaces in iOS and macOS applications. SwiftUI provides a declarative syntax for defining the user interface elements and their behavior.

The calculator UI may include buttons for digits 0-9, as well as buttons for operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. When a button is tapped, the corresponding action is triggered, which could be updating the display value or performing a calculation based on the current state of the calculator.

The display area usually shows the current number or the result of the calculation. As the user taps buttons, the display value is updated accordingly, and the calculator performs the necessary calculations when the user taps the equal (=) button or other arithmetic operation buttons.

Overall, a calculator made with SwiftUI provides a user-friendly interface for performing mathematical calculations efficiently and conveniently.
